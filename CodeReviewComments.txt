Framework comments/enhancements:
1. Removed chromedriver for Mac - Preventing chromedriver to be initialized.
2. Moved the test cases out of the default package and organized in logically grouped packages.
3. Chrome driver had to be upgraded to 2.36 from 2.42 as it was throwing the following error - unknown error: call function result missing 'value'.
4. Added config.properties for easy maintainability. This is a single point of control for the commonly used parameters like the URL and Browser type.
5. Created a ServiceInitializer class which does the following. This creates a level of abstraction and is a common class for all tests.
	a. Loads the config.properties from where url and browser type is fetched.
	b. Checks of the Platform on which the test are running is Windows, Mac or Linux.
	c. Initializes the driver object and sets the required property based on the browser type.
	d. Opens the browser and maximizes the window before starting the test case.
6. Created a Page Object class called HomePage. (Technically it is not a Home Page!)
7. Created a BrowserType enum to fix the possible browsers which can be used.
